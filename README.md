<h1>Joint Warfighter Assessment 18.1 </h1>

 

<h2>Description</h2>
During Joint Warfighter Assessment 18.1, I showcased my expertise and knowledge as a Nodal Network Operator-Maintainer by training seven soldiers on troubleshooting the Joint Network Node, utilizing the signal flow chart. The impact of my efforts was remarkable, as it significantly reduced the Command Post Network teams' troubleshooting time from hours to a mere 1.5 hours. This accomplishment greatly contributed to the overall success of the platoon during the assessment. Moreover, my dedication and skills were further demonstrated at Camp Aachen, Germany, where I played a vital role in the tactical mission.

<h3></h3>
Beyond my assigned responsibilities, I took the initiative to train six soldiers outside of their Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) on the Cisco Call Manager and the Wide Area Network. This adaptability ensured uninterrupted NIPR/SIPR voice and data services for the Bravo Company Command Team and Headquarters & Headquarters Company staff, minimizing any potential downtime. Through my efforts, I effectively supported the mission's objectives and enhanced the operational capabilities of the entire unit.
